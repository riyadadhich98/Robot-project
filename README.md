# Robot-project
Code written in this project is black line follower code
The extension used in this code is .ino
Platform used to run the code is Arduino.
Here we have used 2 sensors 1.Left sensor 2.Right sensor
To move fwrd--both should be black i.e LS && RS 
To move left--LS(Black)&&RS(White)
To move right--LS(White)&&RS(Black)
To Stop      --LS(White)&&RS(White)
This way whole code works.
